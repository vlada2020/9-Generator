# Unit 09 Node.js and ES6+ Homework: Good README Generator

Create a command-line application that dynamically generates a README.md from a user's input. The application will be invoked with the following command:

```sh
node index.js
```
// define three methods, each that either uses a callback or promises structure to handle asychronous requests

The user will be prompted for their GitHub username, 
which will be used to make a call to the GitHub API to retrieve their email and profile image. 
They will then be prompted with questions about their project.

// I need to use the 'FS' or File System module, to write a new file (readme.md) (using Markdown syntax)
The README will be populated with the following:

* At least one badge
* Project title
* Description
* Table of Contents
* Installation
* Usage
* License
* Contributing
* Tests
* Questions
* User GitHub profile picture
* User GitHub email
